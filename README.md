# NeoVim Configurations

A repo containing my Neovim configuration as it is from the nvim base directory.

The old config contains the desired functionality, while the new config contains the desired organization. The old will be used to match functionality until the desired functionality and organization is contained within the new config.

This configuration is heavily inspired by LunarVim and its main goal is to include C++ support.
